HTML and CSS Projects

Here are a list some projects that I have put together using HTML and CSS.

Monster Truck Rally Site:
This page is an example of a home page I put together. It is styled using CSS and HTML. It also has other features like a nabber, image containers and a form.

Movie Theater Site:
This project was made by using bootstrap 4. It contains many bootstrap components including but not limited to a nabber, Jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdown.

Here I was showing various ways we can style and use nabbers.

Created by using a combo of CSS and HTML to style and create a portfolio page.
